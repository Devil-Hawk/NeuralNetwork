# NeuralNetwork


- This is the Entire Neural Network Coursework which I studied at RIT. I learned how to make 3 types of neural networks from scratch. Feed Forward, Recurrent NN's, CNN's, I also Learned frameworks such as PyTorch, JAX. Image Augmentation, Attention and Transformer Networks were also learned by me during this time.
